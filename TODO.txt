- FEATURE: Wake up light
	Black out screen on the "next alarm at..." screen to avoid waking the computer with full brightness
	Show the alarm window first, then hide the "next alarm at..." window as to not blink full brightness
	Slowly fade the alarm window from black to white, somewhere along the line switching text color etc
	Should start screen brightness fade before the alarm starts
- BUG: initial rule "vacation" created with "title contains ''"
- Preferences should be renamed "Set Rules..."
- FEATURE REQUEST: should ask to add itself as a startup item

- Competition parity
    Select playlist per alarm
    "Go to sleep" mode: plays a playlist and fades out after some time to finally sleep the computer
- iPhone port
- Warning when you should to go to bed. Maybe just set how many hours advanced notice you need and it'll warn based on your next alarm?
- Some system to read overriding alarm times from the calendar. Useful for exceptions that you know far in advance, like a plane you need to catch in several weeks
- Should show both exact and relative time for coming alarms
- Should detect if lid is being closed and not delay on that

Feedback from Gunnar:
    click on preview: activate corresponding rule. Scroll to it and blink it by fading in/out twice?
    cmd-T moves to today
    date?
    birthdays? match the actual calendar. maybe have an "all" rule?
    preview: fill the gaps at the edges of the calendar with days
